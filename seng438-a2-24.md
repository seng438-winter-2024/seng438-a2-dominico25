# 1 Introduction

In this lab, we further developed our understanding of software testing by testing the Range and Data Utilities class functions. Our goal is to better understand unit testing through the JUnit framework by developing test functions to test 5 methods of each class through black-box testing methods. Before the lab, we knew from the class lectures that black-box testing meant creating test functions only knowing descriptions of methods and not having access to the source code of methods.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

// including the input partitions you have designed
From rubric: A detailed description of the testing strategy for unit testing and your test-case design approach, i.e., how you used the black-box test-case design techniques equivalence classes, and boundary value analysis. Also list the name of the test cases you have designed and identify which one covers which parts of the strategy (which partition, which class, etc.) Include a discussion about what you feel are the benefits and drawbacks about using mocking.

#### Range Class
For the Range class, the only function with an input value was the contains() function. As a result, it is also the only function able to have partitions and equivalence classes for testing. For this function, strong equivalence class testing and boundary value testing were executed. For equivalence class testing, we developed three test cases/functions to cover values lower than the defined range, within the defined range, and above the defined range. The corresponding test case names are: "testNegativeOutOfRangeValueforMethodContains", "testInRangeValueForMethodContains", and "testPositiveOutOfRangeValueforMethodContains". For boundary value testing, we will create test cases for each of the boundaries for a total of 7 test cases. Three tests will cover the upper boundary, another 3 will cover the lower boundary, and a test will cover a nominal value within the range. The corresponding test case names are: "testBelowUpperBoundaryForMethodContains", "testEqualToUpperBoundaryForMethodContains", "testAboveUpperBoundaryForMethodContains", "testBelowLowerBoundaryForMethodContains", "testEqualToLowerBoundaryForMethodContains", "testAboveLowerBoundaryForMethodContains", and "testNominalValueForMethodContains". For consistency, the same example range will be used across all tests for the Range class. The goal of executing testing in this manner is to cover all of the possible areas where the input might demonstrate failure of the function's intended capabilities. The four remaining functions are getCentralValue(), getLength(), getLowerBound(), and getUpperBound(). All of these functions do not have any input values and only have one test case each that tests the equivalence class for within the desired range. The respective test case names are "testCentralValueShouldBeCorrect", "testLengthShouldBeCorrect", "testMethodGetLowerBound", and "testMethodGetUpperBound". It was decided since these functions only have one equivalence class, that only one test case was also needed. More test cases could only test for different ranges of values, and could not test more of the actual functionality of these methods. Also for this reason, only equivalence class testing could be implemented which is why there are no test cases for boundary value testing for these methods. 


#### Data Utilities Class  
For the Data Utilities class, 


#### Benefits and drawbacks of using mocking
When beginning to write tests for the Data Utilities class it became evident that a different type of testing variable would be necessary, this testing concept would be mocking. Having the ability to set the return values of each of the built-in functions of KeyedValues and Values2D gave us much more control to test specific parts of each datatype object to ensure robust testing. ADD ANOTHER BENEFIT. The main drawback we found when completing tests that used or required mocking was the setup. As it was everybody's first time using mocking there was a slight learning curve which did take some time, however there is sufficient information on this concept available for us to learn from. While you can add a general mock I WILL FINISH THIS LOL

- time to set up each mock for each test

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

The teamwork was managed by dividing the group into pairs that would test each class. Each of the five functions per class was split up among the pair for testing. One person would be responsible for making tests for three methods and the other was responsible for the remaining two. After the test cases were completed, there was an overall review of the test functions by the whole group. This allowed the whole group to understand both the functions they did and the functions the other group members completed. Overall, work was divided fairly and evenly with every group member having the opportunity to learn of and understand the testing processes for all methods tested across both classes.
