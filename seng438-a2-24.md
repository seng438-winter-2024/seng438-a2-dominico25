# 1 Introduction

In this lab, we further developed our understanding of software testing by testing the Range and Data Utilities class functions. Our goal is to develop test functions to test 5 methods of each class through black-box testing methods. Before the lab, we knew from the class lectures that black-box testing meant creating test functions only knowing descriptions of methods and not having access to the source code of methods.

**Range Class**
| **Test Case Name**  | **Function Being Tested** | **Partition** |
|----------------|----------|-----|
| testInRangeValueForMethodContains()   | contains()    | -1 < value < 1    |
| testPositiveOutOfRangeValueForMethodContains()   | contains()    | value > 1    |
| testNegativeOutOfRangeValueForMethodContains()   | contains()    | value < -1    |
| testBelowUpperBoundaryForMethodContains()   | contains()    | value > 1    |
| testEqualToUpperBoundaryForMethodContains()   | contains()    | value = 1    |
| testAboveUpperBoundaryForMethodContains()   | contains()    | value < 1    |
| testBelowLowerBoundaryForMethodContains()   | contains()    | value < -1    |
| testEqualToLowerBoundaryForMethodContains()   | contains()    | value = -1    |
| testAboveLowerBoundaryForMethodContains()   | contains()    | value < -1    |
| testMethodGetLowerBound()   | getLowerBound()    | --    |
| testMethodGetUpperBound()   | getUpperBound()    | --    |

**Data Utilities Class**
| **Test Case Name**  | **Function Being Tested** | **Partition** |
|----------------|----------|-----|
| Test Case Name 1   | Function 1    | Partition 1    |



// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on
the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions
you have explained in the test strategy section //above

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

The teamwork was managed by dividing the group into pairs that would test each class. Each of the five functions per class was split up among the pair for testing. One person would be responsible for making tests for 3 methods and the other was responsible for the remaining 2. After the test cases were completed, there was an overall review of the test functions by the whole group. This allowed the whole group to understand both the functions they did and the functions the other group members completed. Overall, work was divided fairly and evenly with every group member having the opportunity to learn of and understand the testing processes for all methods tested across both classes
